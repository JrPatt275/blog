<div style="text-align: center;">
  <h2>Hello, Azure</h2>
</div>

What better way to start a new blog than to recreate the age old "Hello, World!" on Azure?

This is part one of a three part series, in which we're going to:

1) Create a To-Do list API, using Azure Functions and CosmosDB
2) Deploy both the infrastructure and API, using Bicep and Azure DevOps pipelines
3) Create a Web frontend for the API, framework TBC.
